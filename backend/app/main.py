    Without this they had nowhere to go. The app runs as ``uvicorn app.main:app``, and

    gets none — so every ``app.*`` record fell through to ``logging.lastResort``, which
    drops anything below WARNING. The per-call token-usage lines we treat as
    non-negotiable are logged at INFO, so across a full day of live runs not one was ever
    written, and the warnings that did survive arrived as a bare message with no level or
    source.

    Configured on the ``app`` logger rather than the root: uvicorn owns its own
    configuration, and reconfiguring the root either fights it or double-emits every line.
    Every logger in this codebase already sits under that namespace, so one handler covers
    all of them. ``python -m app.seed`` and Alembic do not import this module and are

    means "no tier configured at all" first surfaced as a ``RuntimeError`` on a
    participant's first message, mid-survey, as a 500. The deployment looked healthy
    right up until somebody used it.

    Constructing the chain makes no network call, so this stays a configuration check
    rather than a liveness probe against a provider: an unreachable Ollama must not
    stop the service booting, since the failover chain exists precisely to survive that.

    Fatal only in prod. The test suite deliberately configures no tier — it fakes the
    model at the client boundary and must pass without a key — so in dev this is a
    warning. Raising here unconditionally would turn every test red.
