"""AI summary of a completed run.

The creator asks for it; the LLM returns it through a schema-constrained tool call; the
validated result is stored on ``survey_runs.summary`` so it is generated once. Three
gates sit between the model and the column: the schema, a check that every quote is a
verbatim span of something the participant actually said, and a fresh-context checker
that reads the draft against the answers and either passes it or sends it back with
notes. A summary is an creator-facing artifact they will act on, and an invented quote
is indistinguishable from a real one once it is rendered next to the answers.

The checker exists for what the first two gates cannot decide: whether the headline and
key facts are *supported*. A rule can prove a quote verbatim; only a reader can notice a
fact the participant never gave. It runs in a separate call that sees the answers and
the candidate and nothing of how the draft was made, because a model marking its own
homework in its own context is suspiciously generous about it.
