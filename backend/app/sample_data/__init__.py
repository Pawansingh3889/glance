"""Curated sample dataset: realistic surveys and conducted runs, drawn from real use.

The JSON files here are the committed source of truth. ``surveys.json`` holds four
published surveys (title, description, and the frozen version definition); ``runs.json``
holds four conducted runs with their verbatim transcripts and recorded answers — three
completed and one in-progress (for resume/follow-up coverage).

Everything refers to seed users by key (the email local-part, e.g. ``remy``), so the
data stays readable and portable across databases. See ``README.md`` for the shape and
how to regenerate it.

Used by ``app.seed`` to give a fresh database meaningful content, and by the test suite
as golden data driven through the conduct engine and the results/export paths.
