"""Idempotent dev seed: a couple of creators and a few participants.

Run with ``python -m app.seed``. Safe to run repeatedly (keyed on id).

These accounts have a **published, shared password**, which is only defensible because
this never runs anywhere real: docker-compose.prod.yml deliberately omits the seed step,
and the whole point of these rows is that a developer can log in without inventing five
accounts first. Override it with ``SEED_PASSWORD`` if that assumption ever stops holding.

Creators exist only here. Self-signup creates participants, so the only way to get an
account that can publish surveys and read everyone's answers is to be given one.
